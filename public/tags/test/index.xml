      <description>Website layout I&amp;rsquo;ve thought to include four sections:
 Home - dashboard of the website which i will try get to show a little bit of content from the three other sections.
 Articles - could have another name. This is where our personal responses and possibly our collective response will be posted.
 Projects - quite a varied space - could be a place to describe our work or projects at varsity our extra curricular / community engagement / personal interests.</description>

      <description>Things I would need from you  Your personal blog post in a word document or something similar.
 If this could be formatted as you would like it to appear then I will try to match as closely as possible in the actual post.   There are a couple of extra fields that I would need some meta-data for in order to make the post as complete as possible:</description>

      <description>Wesite design This really is entirely up to us. I have used the Joburg night skyline. For simplicity and uniformity I have kept this across the main pages. Each blog post and project can then have it&amp;rsquo;s own header and description. I have kept the default projects but you are free customise these fairly extensively.</description>

      <description>Design ideas Thoughts on the post header backgrounds (the geometric kind of pattern at the top of each post):
 choose a picture that describes you choose a picture that highlights one of the ideas you feel is important from your reflections any other thoughts?  Personal reflection ideas  from my side I think we should spend some time on our own going through the reflection questions and compose our personal responses.</description>

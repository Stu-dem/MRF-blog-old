## Website layout

I've thought to include four sections:

1. Home - dashboard of the website which i will try get to show a little bit of content from the three other sections.

2. Articles - could have another name. This is where our personal responses and possibly our collective response will be posted.

3. Projects - quite a varied space - could be a place to describe our work or projects at varsity our extra curricular / community engagement / personal interests.

4. About - this is up to us. Could be a description incorporating MRF descriptions or it could be about the purpose of this website within the MRF space, or whatever else I suppose.

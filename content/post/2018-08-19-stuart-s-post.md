## Design ideas

Thoughts on the post header backgrounds (the geometric kind of pattern at the top of each post):

* choose a picture that describes you
* choose a picture that highlights one of the ideas you feel is important from your reflections
* any other thoughts?

## Personal reflection ideas

* from my side I think we should spend some time on our own going through the reflection questions and compose our personal responses.
  * these responses would then make up your own personal blog post
  * could contain almost any kind of media: 
  
  {{< youtube DNS7i2m4sB0 >}} 
  
> Lame video but something that might be useful for you guys. By the way, this text is formatted as a quote so that it stands out amongst all the other text.

## Group reflection ideas
  
* We could then circulate those responses to allow everyone else to comment on them
  * email list
  * whatsapp group
  * Skype session

## Things I would need from you

1. Your personal blog post in a word document or something similar.

  * If this could be formatted as you would like it to appear then I will try to match as closely as possible in the actual post.
  
2. There are a couple of extra fields that I would need some meta-data for in order to make the post as complete as possible:
    * tags - a listt of tags that are relevent to the content of your reponse
    * description: "Environmental Economist"
    * website - personal website
    * email - personal email
    * twitter - link to twitter account
    * facebook - link to facebook account
    * any other link that you would like shared here as a mini icon
    * avatar image - i have used the default but head over to one of these sites and see if you can find an avatar that represents you. Or we could use actual photos of ourselves? Thoughts?
      * [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/avatar/1)
      * [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/index.php?goto=2&searchform=1&k=avatar&type=&is_selection=&is_premium=&color=&order=2)

3. Any other media that you would like embedded, if you could share those with me too.
